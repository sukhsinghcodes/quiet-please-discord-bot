# Quiet Please Discord Bot

This bot will start off as a simple by replying to messages with certain keywords with a "Quiet please!" and a funny gif using Giphy.

Eventually I will enhance it by adding mini text based games e.g. rock, paper, scissors, etc.

The aim of this is to play around and try different things with the Discord.js library and get more familiar with the devops of AWS.
